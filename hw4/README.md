# Project Title
NTUST Data structure homework4

## Prerequisites
* OS: windows
* IDE: Code::Blocks 17.12
* Compiler: gcc


## Example
* Write a binary search tree to implement the following operations using C++.
  * It first prompts the user for entering a sequence of data elements of type int and constructs a binary search tree by inserting these elements one by one. The elements are ranked such that vi represents the ith smallest element in the binary search tree at any time.
  * The user can then insert or delete from the binary search tree from a menu arbitrarily. If an inserted element already exists in the tree, return “element already existed.” If the element to be deleted does not exist in the tree, simply print out “no match.”
  * In addition, you have to implement a function called minelement which, given a threshold value T, it returns the element vi with the lowest rank r.
