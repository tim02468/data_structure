# Project Title
NTUST Data structure homework5

## Prerequisites
* OS: windows
* IDE: Code::Blocks 17.12
* Compiler: gcc


## Example
* Write a binary search tree to implement the following operations using C++.
  * It first prompts the user to input a sequence of integers to construct a binary search tree, in which each node has an additional field leftSize. The definition of leftSize is the same as given in the textbook.
  * After the BST is constructed, allow a user to perform the following operations:
  1. Insertions and deletions as we did in the previous assignment but remember to update the leftsize field
  2. Write a function called avg(int l, int u) which returns the average of the elements that are ranked lth to uth. An element is ranked ith if and only if it is the ith smallest in the entire list of elements.
