# Project Title
NTUST Data structure homework3

## Prerequisites
* OS: windows
* IDE: Code::Blocks 17.12
* Compiler: gcc


## Example
* Write a C++ program to do the following operations that operate on a polynomial with three variables x, y, and z, stored as a generalized list.
* Construct a generalized list to represent a polynomial, say polyno.
* Implement the following functions:
  * retCoeff (ex,ey,ez) : Return the coefficient of the term in polyno whose three exponents match ezeyex and , , . If there is no match, simply reply to the user with â€œno match."
  * Mulf (ex,ey,ez) : Multiply polyno by ez ey ex.
